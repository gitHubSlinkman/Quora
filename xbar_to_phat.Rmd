```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The sample pro[potion $\hat{p}$ is simply the sample mean with zero-one data.  WE show this below:
$$
\begin{align*}
    \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n} &&  \text{Defintion of sample mean}
            =&  \frac{x}{n}                 &&  \text{where x is the number of ones in the sample}
            
\end{align*}
$$
