## Using normal probabiliy plots to diagnose departures from Normality

This document shows how to normal quantile-quantiles plots to diagnose departure from normality.  Here after we will abreviate Nnormal Qqantile plots as QQ plots.

To do so we must know what the QQ looks like when we sample from the normal population. Wnen we draw a norml QQ plot from a normal distribution we plot the enpirical quantile for the distribution versus the expected quantile.   Suppose we draw a sample size of 1,000 from a normal population with a popukation mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20.  I can draw this random sample as follows in R:

```{r draw_normal_sample}
#
x <- rnorm(1000, mean=10, sd=20 )
x[1:10]
#
```
